NAME
    CGI::Application::Plugin::DevPopup - Runtime cgiapp info in a popup
    window

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
  End user information
    This module provides a plugin framework for displaying runtime
    information about your CGI::Application app in a popup window. A sample
    Timing plugin is provided to show how it works:

        use CGI::Application::Plugin::DevPopup;
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::DevPopup::Timing;

        The rest of your application follows
        ...

    Now whenever you access a runmode, a window pops up over your content,
    showing information about how long the various stages have taken. Adding
    other CAP::DevPopup plugins will get you more information. A HTML::Tidy
    plugin showing you how your document conforms to W3C standards is in the
    works.

  Developer information
    Creating a new plugin for DevPopup is fairly simple. CAP::DevPopup
    registers a new callback point (named "devpopup_report"), which it uses
    to collect output from your plugin. You can add a callback to that
    point, and return your formatted output from there. The callback has
    this signature:

        sub callback($cgiapp_class, $outputref)

    You pass your output to the devpopup object by calling

        $cgiapp_class->devpopup->add_report(
                    title   => $title,
                    summary => $summary,
                    report  => $body
            );

    You are receiving $outputref, because DevPopup wants to be the last one
    to be called in the postrun callback. If you had wanted to act at
    postrun time, then please do so with this variable, and not through a
    callback at postrun.
